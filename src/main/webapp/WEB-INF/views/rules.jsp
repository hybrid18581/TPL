        <p class="text-justify" style="font-size:x-small">
            All the teams will be drawn against each other by randomly created fixtures and their match outcomes will be
            decided by the number of goals they score. There are 5 types of predictions involving increasing amount of
            risk and hence riskier the prediction, the more goals youâ€™ll score for being accurate. Wrong prediction of
            any type gives you 0 goals.

        <h2 style="font-size:medium">Head to head fixtures:</h2>
        <p class="text-justify" style="font-size:x-small">
            All the teams will be drawn against each other into randomly generated fixtures to be played every GW. The
            outcome of these fixtures will depend on the number of goals scored by the teams in each fixture.
        </p>
        <strong style="font-size:medium">Example</strong>
        <p class="text-justify" style="font-size:x-small"> <u>Fixture - Team A Vs Team B</u><br>
            Team A prediction : LCFC Vs Man City, LCFC Win. [Outcome of a match (2 goals)]<br>
            Team B prediction : Norwich Vs Man Utd, Norwich win, Pukki goal. [Outcome of a match AND any one goal scorer
            (3 goals)]<br>
            The actual premier league match results turn out to be:<br>
            LCFC 1-0 Man City, Vardy goal.<br>
            Norwich 2-1 Man Utd, Pukki, Mata, Cantwell goals.<br>
            So that makes the goals scored in the above TPL fixtures:<br>
            Team A 2 - 3 Team B
        </p>
        <p class="text-justify" style="font-size:x-small">
            Winning team in TPL fixture gets 3 points, losing team gets 0 points and a draw gives 1 point each.
            Total points and goal difference decide the position of teams on the league table.
